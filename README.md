# Dog API doodling

* Silly little app written to try out packages like [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).
* App uses [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch images.
* Deployed project to Surge.sh and it can be seen up and running [here](https://dogoapi.surge.sh/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
